- 👋 Hi, I’m @fermarcosmac
- 👀 I’m interested in  AI and ML, specially when applied to audio signal processing, acoustics & music engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Signal Theory and Communications @ ETSIT-UPM, more specifically the “Signal processing and machine learning for big data” track.
- 💞️ I’m also collaborating with Signal Processing Applications Group (GAPS) in the fields of auralization via HRTF and non-linear electro-acoustical system characterization, among others.
